# Faulty-Air-Quality-Sensor-Challenge
In this challenge, my task is to develop a binary clasification model to identify faulty sensors, regardless of the device type. The model will be used to automatically flag devices that have faulty readings.

# About the problem :
AirQo’s air quality sensing network has more than 120 low-cost devices deployed across Uganda; in most cases, these devices are deployed in unmonitored or perilous environments. These low-cost electronic devices are susceptible to breakdown caused by communication malfunction, aging, wear and tear, manufacturing deficiencies, incorrect calibration, mishandling and other external environmental factors. Faults lead to data inaccuracies and data loss, which impacts decisions and policies that could significantly impact people’s lives.
